  How data is Travels throughout the whole Computer System
  All of the computer system components are either they are internal or external 
  are connected to each other and perform an operation.How these components are connected??
  The answer is through buses.
  Buses:
     Buses are the pathways for the travel of information between different components of computer systems.Buses are the collection of wires.The higher the number of wires in a bus means  higher the data transfer rate.let say from childhood we've heared of the Fiber Optic Cable is so expensive because
     its data transfer rate is fast. Actually, in this cable the number of wires(in the form of optical thread) is greater, which leads the higher number of bits to travel across.
     Actually the information passed through these bases is in the form of Binary Data which is supposed to be bit(0,1).At each wire(which is present within the bus), each bit travels at particular time,
     thus, we have to increase the number of wires in a particular bus, the higher the number of wires in a bus leads to the transfer of large number of bits which ultimately increases flow of information.

  Types of Buses:
    Buses are divided according to their nature, they may be external (cables,through which mouse,cpu are connected) or could be internal (electric buses, which are present on the PCB(Physics Circuit Board)).
    
    âœ¨Based on the Components being Connected
    âœ¨Based on the Data being transfer.
    âœ¨Based on the Connectivity.



Based on the Component being Connected:
   System Bus:
   ðŸŽ¯The most important part of computer system ,I mean CPU is connected with other main memory by means of System Bus.
   Thus, system bus connects the RAM and CPU,
   Expansion Bus:
   ðŸŽ¯Expansion bus as the name indicating connects the Central Processing Unit with PCI and PCI Express Slots
   PCI Slots(Peripheral Component Interconnected) are like add ones meaning we can connect the external components
   like GPU, Sound Car and Network Card to boost the efficiency of computer system. The PCI Slots are specific to specific
   type of processors, for the processor of low power has less capable PCI slots, but the processors with higher power has
   PCIe slots(which are the latest version of PCI slots usually coming in the modern PC's,helful in higher transmission of data)
   I/O Bus:
    These Buses Connects the CPU, main memory (RAM) and Input Output devices the data which is transferred 
    between the these compoents is through I/O Buses.most probably by means of Data Bus.

Based on the Data being Transferred:
Address Bus:
 It is used to carry the address between Input Output devices and CPU,What does it mean??
 The answer is simple; as we know that we connect Input and Output devices to our computer system,
 these have different functions and features according to their nature,the question arises?
 Let say I have pressed a key on my keyboard,the CPU, processed it and shown my on screen,but how
 my CPU know that the data is just coming from CPU?
   There comes Address Bus, which has address of my input and output devices, in this case, address
   bus has address of Keyboard, and whenever I press any key or perform any function by my keyboard,
   then simply address bus takes the address of my keyboard and let the CPU know about my devices, in 
   this way CPU determines my keyboard with respect to particular address provided by address bus and then
   execute the command
   âœ”  Address bus is unidirection(meaning data can only be transferred in one direction),in the
   above example from keyboard to CPU.
Data Bus:
    âœ” As the name indicating Data Bus would carries the data between Input/Ouput devices, CPU and
    main memory, 
    âœ¨ The data is in binary format and travels along different components either from CPU to memory, CPU to I/O devices
    or may be from I/0 devices to CPU and RAM.
    âœ” It is bidirectional, meaning the data within the data bus can travels along both directions.

Control Bus:




Based on the Connectivity:
   Actually, the core computer components like main memory, CPU and I/O devices are connected with
   each other by means of device controller circuits, placed on the Motherboard.

   Device Controller Circuts are the special kind of circuits which acts like a bridge between CPU and memory
   and from CPU to Input Output devices, actually these circuits after combination form the Chipsets,each chipset
   is the collection of multiple integrated circuits which are being present on a surface called chipset,this chipset
   has two sides:
   ðŸ”¥Northbridge  connects the Central Processing Unit with RAM and other internal CPU Components like Graphic Cards, Sound Card Network Cards etc.
   ðŸ”¥Southbridge  connects the Central Processing Unit with external devices like Mouse, Keyboard and output devices like Speaker.
